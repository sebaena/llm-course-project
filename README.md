# LLM-course-project
This repository has a simple web application that uses openAI (gpt-4) to recommend books. This project was done for the Aalto University LLM course

An API key from open AI is required to run the application. Set it as environment variable ( for nix based systems), for example:

export OPENAI_API_KEY="WRITE OPENAI KEY"
